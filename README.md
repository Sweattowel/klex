Context and Purpose:
    Klex serves as a energy and electrical service platform, users may review their own electrical use with associated data, and can make appointments/requests for electrical services that are provided on the page

What can or can be expected to be learned:
    During development i encountered an issue about types of data storage, SQL works for accounts, it works for booleans but for data such as per day use for months in which can include 28-31 individual days this may prove inefficient, 
    Theme styling that remains consistant and looks good/decent from every standpoint
    Using new technology such as online Database platforms, was expecting to maybe use AWS but pricing proved to be a point of contention
    
Current issues:
    Headers are not being set properly which leads to issues in the interceptor
